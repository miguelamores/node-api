#mvc branch has model, view, controller and dependency injection. It uses 3 different models:
   - A json file
   - A mongodb database hosted in Atlas
   - A mysql database installed locally. A script.sql can be used to create the database

# The pachage.json has the exact commands for each model
    "start:mysql"
    "start:local"
